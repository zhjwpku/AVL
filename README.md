This is a AVL implementation in C/C++

Forked from [https://github.com/jonnyhsy/AVL](https://github.com/jonnyhsy/AVL) with some little changes:

1. add Makefile
2. add printBST to make it easy to see the result of insert and delete
3. The Rotation function are named after the wikipedia AVL_tree

Most of the printBST code are borrowed from [how to pretty print binary tree/](https://articles.leetcode.com/how-to-pretty-print-binary-tree/)

If you read Chinese, you may have a look at this page: [AVL Tree](http://zhjwpku.com/2017/11/21/avl-tree.html)
